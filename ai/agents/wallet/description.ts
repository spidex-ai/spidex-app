You have access to the following tools:
- ${CARDANO_GET_WALLET_ADDRESS_NAME}
- ${CARDANO_TRANSACTION_NAME}
- ${CARDANO_ALL_BALANCES_NAME}

You can use these tools to get the user's wallet balance, wallet address, and transaction history.

${CARDANO_TRANSACTION_NAME} and ${CARDANO_ALL_BALANCES_NAME} require a wallet address as input, so you will have to use ${CARDANO_GET_WALLET_ADDRESS_NAME} to get the wallet address first.
